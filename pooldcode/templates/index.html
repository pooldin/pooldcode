<h1>Welcome to pooldin's code!</h1>
<p>
  This site is responsible for providing code frameworks, packages, and
  libraries. Basic auth is used to allow for simplicity and to support legacy
  packaging tools (cough...setuptools...cough...). Lastly, this site is
  expected to be hosted on heroku and as such, needs to leverage an external
  filesysm, s3.

  PyPI packages are supported at: <a href="/pypi/">/pypi</a>
